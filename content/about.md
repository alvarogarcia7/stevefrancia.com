Steve has the unique distinction of leading two of the most successful
open source companies in history as the Chief Operator of Docker and the
former Chief Developer Advocate of MongoDB where he was responsible for
the developer experience of MongoDB.

He has been involved in open source for over 20 years and is the creator
of some of the most widely used open source projects including Hugo,
, spf13-vim & Cobra. Steve is a very active member of the Go community and
has been an organizer of GopherCon and GothamGo. He is a member of the
Go Conduct Board.

He loves open source and is thrilled to be able to work on it full time
and then some.  When not coding, he is usually having fun outdoors with
his wife and four children.
