Steve has the unique distinction of leading two of the most successful
open source companies in history first as the Chief Developer Advocate
of MongoDB where he was responsible for the developer experience of
MongoDB and most recently as the Chief Operator of Docker.


His background is software development where he has been involved in
open source for over 20 years and is the creator of some of the most
widely used open source projects including Hugo, spf13-vim & Cobra.
Steve is a very active member of the Go community and has been an
organizer of GopherCon and GothamGo.

He loves open source and is thrilled to be able to work on it full time
and then some.  When not coding, he is usually having fun outdoors with
his wife and four children.
